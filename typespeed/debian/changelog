  * Add a watch file.
  * Update the upstream URL in the copyright fiile.
  * Add a new description with the package's homepage.
  * Declare CFLAGS as a variable in debian/rules so that it can be overridden

 -- Dafydd Harries <daf@muse.19inch.net>  Sun,  1 Aug 2004 01:39:38 +0100

typespeed (0.4.4-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/postinst:
    - Only do configuration things when called with "configure".
    - Don't fail if there are no high score files to move.

    - Insert entries by security team that went missing.

 -- Dafydd Harries <daf@muse.19inch.net>  Wed, 24 Mar 2004 14:33:11 +0000

typespeed (0.4.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Seems using dpkg-statoverride was the wrong thing to do.
    - debian/postinst, debian/postrm: Remove calls to dpkg-statoverride.
    - debian/rules: Call chmod instead for correct permissions.

 -- Dafydd Harries <daf@muse.19inch.net>  Wed, 24 Mar 2004 12:55:44 +0000

typespeed (0.4.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/postinst: Rewritten; hopefully saner now:
    - No longer tries to clean up files mis-installed by 0.3.5.3 - the note in
      README.Debian about it remains.
    - Don't try to compare md5sums of high score files - my understanding is
      that they're arch-specific anhow. Simply back up existing ones, create
      new ones, and restore the backups - this will create empty high score
      files for new word lists while preserving old high score files from
      previous versions.
  * debian/postrm: Generalise high score file removal.
  * debian/menu: Add quotes in order to satisfy lintian.
  * debian/control: Add versioned dependency on debhelper (>> 4).
  * debian/README.Debian: Tidying up; update name and timestamp.
  * debian/rules: Remove stamp files earlier on, in accordance with policy,
    other small tidyings up.
  * debian/copyright: Fix typo, some tidying up.

typespeed (0.4.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Appologies to everyone involved for not uploading this sooner; it was
    sitting ready to go in my home directory, but it had slipped my mind.
  * Did s/char merkk/int merkk/ in file.c and removed now obsolete
    flag -fsigned-char as per suggestion from C.M. Connelly <c@eskimo.com>
    in Bug#66316.  This does not close the bug, as typespeed is still
    unusable on PowerPC and possibly other bigendian architectures.
  * Set Build-Depends: libncurses5-dev instead of libncurses-dev to force
    libncurses5 to be used.  (Closes: #79743)

 -- William Ono <wmono@debian.org>  Fri, 29 Dec 2000 15:55:24 -0800

typespeed (0.4.0-5) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * postinst now uses --makescorefiles to generate appropriate high score
    files for each architecture.  This allows typespeed to actually function
    on non-i386 machines.  Nothing else has been touched, so this should be
    safe to install in frozen(potato).  (Closes: #61890)
  * bashisms fixed in postinst and postrm (Closes: #63109)

 -- William Ono <wmono@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Jun 2000 11:11:07 -0700

typespeed (0.4.0-3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Depends: fileutils (>=4.0-5) so the postrm script
    doesn't fail miserably in some cases.  (Closes: #61126)

 -- William Ono <wmono@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Mar 2000 12:39:18 -0800

typespeed (0.4.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

    copyright file from README.Debian to comply with policy
  * Added note in README.Debian and warning in postinst about bug in
    0.3.5-3 (Closes: #45305)
  * Added Danish translation of Peter Maydell's manpage by Bo Vagner HÃ¸jer.

 -- William Ono <wmono@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Sep 1999 22:38:04 -0700

typespeed (0.3.5-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now includes manpage written by Peter Maydell (Closes: #43276)

 -- William Ono <wmono@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Sep 1999 15:22:58 -0700

typespeed (0.3.5-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixes dumb bug in postinst: now does cd to correct directory
    (Closes: #44814)

 -- William Ono <wmono@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Sep 1999 14:40:12 -0700

typespeed (0.3.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now removes /var/lib/games/typespeed on purge.
  * Reversed the movement of information made in 0.3.5-2
  * copyright now refers to /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL

 -- William Ono <wmono@debian.org>  Sun,  5 Sep 1999 10:33:25 -0700

typespeed (0.3.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved information about modification made in 0.3.4-1 into
    copyright from README.Debian.
  * Now creates missing /var/lib/games/typespeed/high.words.* in postinst
    to avoid making the high score files conffiles.

 -- William Ono <wmono@debian.org>  Fri,  6 Aug 1999 16:18:22 -0700

typespeed (0.3.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.

 -- William Ono <wmono@debian.org>  Sun,  1 Aug 1999 00:46:59 -0700

typespeed (0.3.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Debian package release.
  * Directories for high score files and word list files were hard-coded
    using #ifdef DEBIAN.  This is a nasty kludge that avoids typespeed's
    need to have all of its files in the same directory.

 -- William Ono <wmono@debian.org>  Fri, 16 Jul 1999 23:43:13 -0700
