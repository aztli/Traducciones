Patches are applied using quilt. For information on quilt, see:

  /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source

However, debian/patches is generated from the 'patches' git branch as follows:

  $ rm debian/patches/*
  $ git format-patch -o debian/patches ..patches
  $ ls debian/patches/*.patch > debian/patches/series
